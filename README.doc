Sprint Review 

What did you learn from doing our first sprint?
During our first sprint, we learned that it is important to start early and how important the sprint planning process is. At our first team meeting, we divided up the task and discussed the different user stories that we wanted to accomplish during the sprint. By meeting and discussing this upfront we had a unified goal that we could all work for. This was extremely important because it allowed us to understand what everyone was working on and it allowed us to easily discuss progress that was being made at our daily standup meeting. We also learned the importance of branches and how to use them to prevent overwriting other group members' code. We had multiple times where we worked on the project at the same time and without the various branches we created, we would have overwritten each other's code.

What went well? Why?
It went well working as a team and splitting up tasks and roles to each person, and we all provided help and feedback to each other on the tasks we completed.
Another thing that went well was the set time we had arranged for our standup meeting. Prior to the sprint, we all agreed on times that our group would be able to meet to discuss how our individual parts are going. Finding times that everyone in the group can meet is difficult due to our different schedules but we were able to find times that work for everyone. Going forward, we plan to keep a similar schedule because of how well it worked for the group. Additionally, if there was every last minute timing conflict that arose, everyone did a great job of communicating these conflicts so we could make the necessary adjustment to our meeting times. 
We also did a great job communicating with the client and getting her feedback for all the requirements. 

What didn’t go well? Why not?
The biggest challenge that our team faced was the JustInTime free trial expiring. When this expired, we were unable to make changes to our prototype. For this reason, we could only base our html code on the couple of page prototypes we had already completed prior to the expiration. Another challenge that we faced was getting the link for the site from firebase. Originally, we planned on having Kate deploy the website but for some reason it wouldn’t let us. Olivia was able to deploy the website and get the issues figured out. There were also a lot of specifics with layouts and spacing of features on the website that took time to get buttons/columns/images placed where we wanted. 

How can you make things better next time?
Both of the situations in which we ran into issues were one time tasks. For this reason, there isn’t much we can do in future sprints to make things go better than they did. Overall, we agreed that we were very pleased with how our sprint turned out and plan to take the same approach on upcoming sprints. The one thing that we plan on changing going forward is planning out our sprint tasks so we can better estimate the workloads of every task. It was hard to determine this in our first print because we did not really remember how long it would take for various tasks to be completed. Now that we have a better understanding of tasks durations, we will be able to better assign tasks going forward.

Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
We are satisfied with what we completed so far, as we have accomplished all of the user stories that we selected for this sprint. We designed the look of the website with HTML and CSS and created navigation between pages. Now we have a deliverable that we can show our client to get some feedback for our next sprint, which is very important for continuous improvement of the project in future sprints. We used her requirements and communicated with her often to use features she wanted in the website.
While we have a rough outline of what the website will look like, there are some edits that we did not have enough time to complete. In this sense, we did not complete absolutely everything that we had hoped to, but we will continue to add these changes during the next sprint. 

Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
Group 1 was invited, everybody was present. We observed that we ran into similar problems as the group we talked to with updating our scrum board and making incremental changes. The other group told us it was good that we were using branches to collaborate on github, instead of just having one branch. We got to learn how their team is approaching documentation, issues with HTML, and overall feedback, which was helpful. 



Sprint 2 User stories

Sprint 2 Review

What did you learn from doing our second sprint?

During our second sprint we learned how to turn a prototype and ideas from the client into a functioning, dynamic product. We learned how to add in different aspects of front-end functionality, like switching between pages, adding various buttons for different customization options and adding modals to allow the user to sign up/sign in. 

We also learned the importance of having a solid database design in the background. By creating various diagrams and talking to the user about what data they will need to access, we were able to design and adjust a NoSQL database in firebase that will be incorporated into various aspects of the website, like customers, orders and reviews. 

Finally, we learned about flexibility and that adjustments may need to be made during the sprint, in addition to between sprints. Team members sometimes adjusted their tasks to help complete some of the more urgent tasks. This was crucial for us in completing our second sprint. In addition, it is important to be willing to re-prioritize some tasks. For example, we needed to move our task of creating a single page app to a higher priority because other tasks, like adding javascript depended on this. 


What did go well? Why?

Our communication throughout the sprint was very good. We kept each other updated daily on what we were working on and what we needed help with. This likely went well because we had set the expectation that we were going to do daily updates in the last sprint, and so this was easy to keep up with this sprint. We communicated with the client very well and have followed mostly every request she has had. 


What didn’t go well? Why not?

One thing that did not go well was following the timing and tasks that were assigned to each team member. As all of us have busy schedules, it was difficult to find enough time everyday to make good progress on the project.

Adding in javascript was also a challenge this sprint. The team spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to connect the database to the website in meaningful ways. From this, we found that the single page app needed to be implemented earlier than expected, which changed the timeline. This may have also contributed to the lack of progress mentioned earlier. JavaScript was also difficult to attach to every event and button. 


How can you make things better next time?

Next sprint we will try to map the timeline more accurately and allow more time for each task. We will discuss with the client to find out what her top priorities are and focus on those, instead of worrying about other extra ideas. 


Are you satisfied with what you already completed?

I think we would like to be further along, especially since there is only one sprint left. We were hoping to have all the necessities completed on our website and leave touching up/extra features for sprint 3. 

Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?

We ended up meeting with both groups, and the most significant observation was that all three of us are facing similar problems. The JavaScript came with various issues, some of which will still need to be addressed in the next sprint. We find ourselves in a very similar position with group three, as they are nearly finished with the customer-facing side and plan to work on the project owner side in the next sprint. Additionally, we learned that their client is very different from ours; our clients have a list of potential ideas that they would love to see us figure out, while their clients don't have much input, including on items such as price. All group members were present in both meetings.
