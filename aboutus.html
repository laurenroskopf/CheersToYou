    <p>Hey there! I’m Alice- artist and maker
        located in Cedarburg, WI.<br> I create a modern version of a vintage
        classic- hand-lettered pennants & garlands- made from premium wool blend felts.
        <br>Need a unique gift? Decorating for a celebration? Adding a personal touch to a space?<br>Everything is
        designed to raise the ordinary to a little “extra”ordinary!
        <br>When I’m not behind my sewing machine, I’m busy being a teacher, a traveler, and a mom. I’m always looking
        for ways to celebrate and cheer for the people I love- so much joy❤️
        <br>Cheers to YOU!
    </p>
